# Algebraic Causality Theory (ACT): First-Principles Prediction of α

## Overview
Algebraic Causality Theory (ACT) is a novel framework proposing that fundamental physical constants emerge as statistical invariants from the dynamics of causal tetrahedral networks, rather than being free parameters.

This repository contains the complete computational model that predicts the inverse fine-structure constant **α⁻¹ ≈ 136.7** from first principles.

## Key Prediction
The model predicts the value of the inverse fine-structure constant with high precision:
